=============

A personal framework with 3 level permission(User\Role\Resoure)

It uses Spring MVC, Spring, Spring JDBC and Spring Security, and uses jQuery and  EasyUI for the UI.

You can use it as a demo for Spring Security.


Before you run the web application, you must create an empty database named `permission_3level`.

Then when you run the web application, flyway will create the tables and import the initial datas.
